# To Do List

This project is built with Node.js and EJS to enable dynamicly changing values. It features express.js and a local server to remember the user added to-dos and theme preferences. A theme is pulled up from an object of themes randomly as the user clicks the button. 

The web app is hosted on Render with every change pushed to Github with Git version control.
